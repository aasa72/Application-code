			<h1>SASS</h1>
			<p>
			SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessing language 
			that translates into CSS. It allows usage of mechanisms from 
			object-oriented languages, for example variables, mixins and loops, 
			wich simplifies the work on large projects where you wonÂ´t have to write
			as many repetitions.
			SASS nests the code, to give it the same look as HTML.
